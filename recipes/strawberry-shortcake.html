  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Step 1: Gather the ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 2: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch 
      cake pan with butter and lightly dust with flour. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 3: Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/3 cup of white sugar. Set aside. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 4: Combine flour, 1/4 cup of white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a 
      medium bowl; cut in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture 
      resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of mixture; add beaten egg, 
      half-and-half, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir mixture until just combined and 
      no dry spots remain, being careful not to overmix.
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 5: Spoon batter evenly into prepared cake pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 6: Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake 
      comes out clean and top is golden brown, about 18 minutes. Let cool partially 
      in cake pan, about 10 minutes. Flip cake onto a clean work surface.
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 7: Meanwhile, beat heavy cream, powdered sugar, and remaining 1 teaspoon 
      vanilla with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 
      about 3 minutes. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 8: Cut partially cooled cake in half horizontally, making 2 layers; set 
      top layer aside. Drain reserved strawberries in a colander placed over a small 
      bowl, reserving any juice. Brush strawberry juice evenly over top of bottom 
      cake layer. Evenly arrange ½ of the drained strawberries over bottom layer of cake.
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 9: Spread ½ of whipped cream evenly over strawberries; place top cake layer 
      over whipped cream. Top with remaining strawberries and whipped cream. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Step 10: Serve and enjoy!
